Sunspots are temporary phenomena on the Sun's photosphere that appear as spots darker than the surrounding areas. They are regions of reduced surface temperature caused by concentrations of magnetic field flux that inhibit convection. Sunspots usually appear in pairs of opposite magnetic polarity.

%sunspot paper
The important feature of the sun’s outer regions is the existence of a reasonably strongmagnetic field. To the lowest order of approximation, the sun’s magnetic field is dipolar in character and is axisymmetric. The strength of the field at a typical point on the solar surface is approximately a few gauss. There is, however significant variation in this value and there are localized regions (called sunspots) in which the field can be much higher.Because of the symmetry of the twisted magnetic lines at the origin of sunspots, they are generally seen in pairs or in groups of pairs on both sides of the solar equator.

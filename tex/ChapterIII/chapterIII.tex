\section{Sunspots}
On the Sun's photosphere there is a strong magnetic field. However in some localized regions (called \textbf{sunspots}), the field is significant higher and the surface appear as spots darker than the surrounding areas.

\subsection{Raw data}
The SIDC, a department of the Royal Observatory of Belgium, provides, through one of its project, two databases of the sunspot number \cite{sidc}. \\
The first one provides daily measures from 01-01-1818 and the other one the monthly means from 01-01-1749. The relative plots can be found in \autoref{fig:ss}.

\subsection{Data Analysis}
DFAk, illustrated in \autoref{sec:dfa}, is applied to the sunspot databases. 

\subsubsection{Profile plot}
\autoref{fig:dailyprofile} and \autoref{fig:monthlyprofile} shows the profile $\{Y_n\}$ defined in \autoref{step1}. 

The profile is split in equal time windows $\tau$, as illustrated in \autoref{step2} and each division is fitted with a polynomial of $k$th order, as in \autoref{step3}.\\ 
As an example, in \autoref{fig:profilemain}, different time windows with their relative fit are plotted.

	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{The profile $\{Y_n\}$, defined as \autoref{step1} and relative to data in \autoref{fig:ss}}\label{fig:profile}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Log-log plot}
As describe in \autoref{step4}, the total variance $F_2^{( k )}(\tau)$ is estimated for equally spaced $\log(\tau)$.

Firstly, neglecting the section with few points, DFA1 gives same results at the same $\tau$, independently from the frequency of sampling, as in \autoref{fig:dailyDFA1} and \autoref{fig:monthlyDFA1}.

Secondly, the plots shows that the the time series have different slopes, at different time scale. Ideally, however, if a process is self-affinal, the log-log plot of $F_2^{( k )}(\tau)$ should be a straight line. This could mean that the process has different behaviour at different time scale, or that the order of detrend $k$ is too low.

As it is illustrated in \autoref{fig:profilemain}, the order $k=7$ can't fit properly a time window $\tau > \SI{280}{months}$. Analogously, lower $k$ capability of fitting is limited. 

OLS can't fit the sunspots $Y_n$ with a polynomial of order 8 or bigger, because of the overflow of double in C program.

A comparison of DFA$k$ with different $k$ is plotted in \autoref{fig:DFAk}. 
The behaviour of the time series is the same in windows well detrended (dashed line).\\ 
The series in DFA7 shows two behaviour, and so is multi-fractal:
\begin{itemize}
	\item for $\tau \le \SI{132}{months}$, $\alpha(q) \in (0.5, 1)$ and so the process is a stationary long-range memory one.
	\item for $\SI{132}{months} < \tau \le \SI{280}{months}$, $\alpha(q) \in (2, 2.5)$ 
	\item for $\tau > \SI{280}{months}$, the series is not correct detrended.
\end{itemize}

In \autoref{sec:hdfa} nothing is said about process with $\alpha(q)>2$, and I have no idea on how to give an interpretation to this result. 

Comparing with the same work done by Movahed et al. \cite{Movahed_2006}, the DFA1 applied on all dataset gives the same result. However their estimation on $F_2^{( k )}(\tau)$ is much more unstable, and so the residuals have a more casual distribution.

\end{figure}

To remove the sinusoidal trend, Movahed et al. applied a Fourier-DFA. It consist in Fourier transform the time series, set to zero the first 50 terms, anti-transform, and then applying the DFA1. However I got inconsistent results comparing to them. Moreover, the profile keep showing a trend, that can't be remove with a DFA1.

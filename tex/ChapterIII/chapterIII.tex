\section{Sunspots}
On the Sun's photosphere there is a strong magnetic field. However in some localized regions (called \textbf{sunspots}), the field is significant higher and the surface appear as spots darker than the surrounding areas. Their number varies according to the approximately 11-year solar cycle. 

\subsection{Raw data}
The SIDC, a department of the Royal Observatory of Belgium, supplies, through one of its project, two databases of the sunspot number \cite{sidc}. \\
The first one provides daily measures from 01-01-1818 and the other one the monthly means from 01-01-1749. The relative plots can be found in \autoref{fig:ss}.

\subsection{Data Analysis}
This section is inspired by the work of Movahed \etal\cite{Movahed_2006}. However, I choose to developed a slightly different DFA$k$, which is illustrated in \autoref{sec:dfa}, because the sampling frequency is not constant, especially "in the old days" and in the daily measured time series.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Profile of sunspot number}
\autoref{fig:dailyprofile} and \autoref{fig:monthlyprofile} show the profile $\{Y_n\}$ defined in \autoref{step1}. \\
The profile is then split in equal time windows $\tau$, as illustrated in \autoref{step2} and each division is fitted with a polynomial of $k$th order, as in \autoref{step3}.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Comparison of two databases}
As describe in \autoref{step4}, the total variance $F_2^{( k )}(\tau)$ is estimated for 300 equally spaced $\log(\tau)$ and using $m = 10$.\\
Neglecting the section with the biggest $\tau$s (and also few points), $\alpha(2)$ parameter estimated by DFA1 describes the same behaviour at the same $\tau$, independently from the frequency of sampling, in the comparison between \autoref{fig:dailyDFA1} and \autoref{fig:monthlyDFA1}.\\
Also for higher $k$, the estimation of Hurst exponent provides the same results between 4 and 450 months. For convenience, the following work is presented for monthly mean sunspots data only. 

\paragraph{Considerations on DFA1}
The plots in \autoref{fig:DFA} show that time series have different slopes at different time scales. Ideally, however, if a process is self-affinal, the log-log plot of $F_2^{( k )}(\tau)$ should be a straight line. This could mean that the process has different behaviour at different time scales or that the order of detrend $k$ is too low.

\paragraph{Problems of DFA$k$}
A comparison of DFA$k$ with different $k$ is plotted in \autoref{fig:DFAk}. 
The behaviour of time series is the same in windows where it is well detrended (dashed line fits in \autoref{fig:DFAk}).

As illustrated for example in \autoref{fig:profilemain}, the polynomial of order $k=7$ cannot fit properly a time window $\tau > \SI{280}{months}$. Analogously, lower $k$ capability of fitting is limited. 

OLS cannot fit the sunspots $\{Y_n\}$ with a polynomial of order 8 or bigger, because of the overflow of double in C program.

\paragraph{Considerations on DFA7}
The series, through DFA7, shows at least two behaviour, and so is multi-fractal. In particular:
\begin{itemize}
	\item for $\tau \le \SI{132}{months}$, $\alpha(2) \in (0.5, 1)$ and so the process is a stationary long-range memory one.
	\item for $\SI{132}{months} < \tau \le \SI{280}{months}$, $\alpha(2) \in (2, 2.5)$ 
	\item for $\tau > \SI{280}{months}$, the series is not correctly detrended.
\end{itemize}

In \autoref{sec:hdfa} nothing is said about process with $\alpha(2)>2$. Actually the literature is not so rich and in Movahed \etal\cite{Movahed_2006} it is given a proof that $\alpha(2) \in (1, 2)$ only for fractional Brownian motion.\\
Assuming I have made no mistake, my hypothesis is that time series has a multi-dimensional noise, like a bifractional Brownian motion.

Anyway, 132 months is not a random time scale, because is the period of solar cycle.

\subsubsection*{Comparison with other authors}
Comparing with the same work done by Movahed \etal\cite{Movahed_2006}, the DFA1 applied on every dataset gives the same result. However their estimation on $F_2^{( k )}(\tau)$ is more unstable, and so the residuals are much bigger and the  uncertainty on $\alpha$ parameters are higher.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Fourier DFA}
To remove the sinusoidal trend, Movahed \etal \ apply a F50-DFA1. It consists in Fourier transforming the profile $\{ Y_n \}$, setting to zero the first 50 terms, anti-transforming, and then applying the DFA1. \\
In general, F$n$-DFA$k$ indicates the DFA$k$, where the first $n$ terms of real Fourier transform are set to 0.  

In \autoref{fig:f50} and \autoref{fig:f100} the first 50 and 100 terms are removed from the profile. However, the graph of \autoref{fig:f50} still contains a trend. This is also evident because F50-DFA1 and DFA1 (\autoref{fig:monthlyDFA1}) for sufficient small $\tau$ gives the same $\alpha(2)$.\\
For small $\tau$, F100-DFA works, because the estimation of time series behaviour is compatible with DFA$k$ with $k>1$.

However, F-DFA do not provides information for big $\tau$, because the lowest frequencies are removed and so the variance for long period become constant. 

In this case, my observations are different from Movahed and coworkers' ones. They assert that a F50-DFA1 is sufficient. In my opinion instead, a sinusoidal trend is still evident. 

\subsection{Final considerations}
DFA$k$ is a powerful method for the analysis of time series. However, in the studies about sunspots data, there are several problems, linked with $\sin^2$ trend of the series.\\
In particular, the approximation with polynomials does not allow to evaluate the behaviour for big periods, and also alternative ways, like Fourier-DFA, can lead to inconclusive results.

Moreover, the theory about long-range dependency, self-similarity and multifractal processes is relative new and needs to be explored deeper.\\
In general, anyway, non-linear systems can cause errors and misunderstandings in numeric analysis also if the approach is only slightly different. They must be treated carefully. I encourage to check and compare Movahed and coworkers' paper and this essay.

\section{Sunspots}
On the Sun's photosphere there is a strong magnetic field. However in some localized regions (called \textbf{sunspots}), the field is significant higher and the surface appear as spots darker than the surrounding areas.

\subsection{Raw data}
The SIDC, a department of the Royal Observatory of Belgium, provides, through one of its project, two databases of the sunspot number \cite{sidc}. \\
The first one provides daily measures from 01-01-1818 and the other one the monthly means from 01-01-1749. The relative plots can be found in \autoref{fig:ss}.

\subsection{Data Analysis}
DFA$k$, illustrated in \autoref{sec:dfa}, is applied to the sunspot databases. 

\paragraph{Profile of sunspot number}
\autoref{fig:dailyprofile} and \autoref{fig:monthlyprofile} shows the profile $\{Y_n\}$ defined in \autoref{step1}. \\
The profile is split in equal time windows $\tau$, as illustrated in \autoref{step2} and each division is fitted with a polynomial of $k$th order, as in \autoref{step3}.\\ 
As an example, in \autoref{fig:profilemain}, different time windows with their relative fit are plotted.

	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{The profile $\{Y_n\}$, defined as \autoref{step1} and relative to data in \autoref{fig:ss}}\label{fig:profile}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Comparison of two databases}
As describe in \autoref{step4}, the total variance $F_2^{( k )}(\tau)$ is estimated for equally spaced $\log(\tau)$.\\
Neglecting the section with the biggest $\tau$s (and also few points), $\alpha(2)$ parameter estimated by DFA1 describes the same behaviour at the same $\tau$, independently from the frequency of sampling, in the comparison between \autoref{fig:dailyDFA1} and \autoref{fig:monthlyDFA1}.\\
Also for higher $k$, the estimation of Hurst Exponent provides the same results between 4 and 450 months. For convenience, the following work is presented for monthly mean sunspots data. 

\paragraph{Considerations on DFA1}
The plots in \autoref{fig:DFA} show that the time series have different slopes at different time scales. Ideally, however, if a process is self-affinal, the log-log plot of $F_2^{( k )}(\tau)$ should be a straight line. This could mean that the process has different behaviour at different time scale, or that the order of detrend $k$ is too low.

\paragraph{Problems of DFA$k$}
As illustrated for example in \autoref{fig:profilemain}, the polynomial of order $k=7$ can't fit properly a time window $\tau > \SI{280}{months}$. Analogously, lower $k$ capability of fitting is limited. 

OLS can't fit the sunspots $Y_n$ with a polynomial of order 8 or bigger, because of the overflow of double in C program.

\paragraph{Considerations on DFA7}
A comparison of DFA$k$ with different $k$ is plotted in \autoref{fig:DFAk}. 
The behaviour of the time series is the same in windows well detrended (dashed line).\\ 
The series in DFA7 shows two behaviour, and so is multi-fractal:
\begin{itemize}
	\item for $\tau \le \SI{132}{months}$, $\alpha(2) \in (0.5, 1)$ and so the process is a stationary long-range memory one.
	\item for $\SI{132}{months} < \tau \le \SI{280}{months}$, $\alpha(2) \in (2, 2.5)$ 
	\item for $\tau > \SI{280}{months}$, the series is not correct detrended.
\end{itemize}

In \autoref{sec:hdfa} nothing is said about process with $\alpha(2)>2$. Actually the literature is not so rich and in Movahed et al. \cite{Movahed_2006} it is given only a proof that $\alpha(2) \in (1, 2)$ only for fractional Brownian motion.\\
Assuming I have made no mistake, my hypothesis is that time series has a multi-dimensional noise, like a bifractional Brownian motion.

\subsubsection*{Comparison with other authors}
Comparing with the same work done by Movahed et al. \cite{Movahed_2006}, the DFA1 applied on all dataset gives the same result. However their estimation on $F_2^{( k )}(\tau)$ is much more unstable, and so the residuals have a more casual distribution. 

\paragraph{Fourier DFA}
To remove the sinusoidal trend, Movahed et al. applied a F50-DFA1. It consist in Fourier transform the profile $\{ Y_n \}$, set to zero the first 50 terms, anti-transform, and then applying the DFA1. \\
In general, F$n$-DFA$k$ indicates the DFA$k$, where the first $n$ terms of real Fourier transform are set to 0.  

In \autoref{fig:f50} and \autoref{fig:f100} the first 50 and 100 terms are removed from the profile. However, the graph of \autoref{fig:f50} still contains a trend. This is also evident because F50-DFA1 and DFA1 (\autoref{fig:monthlyDFA1}) for sufficient small $\tau$ gives the same $\alpha(2)$.\\
For small $\tau$, F100-DFA works, because the estimation of time series behaviour is compatible with DFA$k$ with $k>1$.

However, F-DFA do not provides information for big $\tau$, because the lowest frequencies are removed and so the variation for long period become constant. 

In this case, my conclusion are different from Movahed et al.. They assert that a F50-DFA1 is sufficient. In my opinion instead, a sinusoidal trend is still evident. Moreover, their graphs of $F_2^{( k )}(\tau)$ are similar to a straight line with high variance.

	abstract = {We use multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA), to study sunspot number
	fluctuations. The result of the MF-DFA shows that there are three crossover timescales in
	the fluctuation function. We discuss how the existence of the crossover timescales is related
	to a sinusoidal trend. Using Fourier detrended fluctuation analysis, the sinusoidal trend is
	eliminated. The Hurst exponent of the time series without the sinusoidal trend is
	0.12 Â± 0.01. Also we find that these fluctuations have multifractal nature. Comparing the MF-DFA
	results for the remaining data set to those for shuffled and surrogate series, we
	conclude that its multifractal nature is almost entirely due to long range correlations.}
